This is a difficult and uncertain time. At best our routines have changed and at worst you or a loved one has been directly effected by Corona. So please dont feel any pressure to do anything extraordinary or 'achieve' something. Only if you feel up to it and think it will be good for your mental health. Please rememeber your mental health comes first always.

<p>If you don't want a new hobby but do feel like you want to do something to boost your mental health in these strange times why not consider:</p>
<h4>Meditating!</h4> 
<p>This is a great way to relieve stress (although it is not for everyone and does not replace professional help), try out apps such as Balance or Headspace.</p>

<h3>Or just stick to your daily routine. Introducing some normalacy in this highly abnormal time might be just what you need.</h3>

<h5>And please rememeber, with all things in life, even though we do not know how long this is going to last, this too is temporary</h5>
